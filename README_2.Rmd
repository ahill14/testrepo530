# R Markdown
This is a Markdown document in RStudio.   
It is a great way to distribute finalized code and findings. 

## Code
Here is a chunk of code that I will include in my report: 
``` {r}
str(cars)
mean(cars$speed)
mean(cars$dist)
```
 
## Equations
You can also embed mathematical equations like this:  
Add 3 and 5: 
$$ 3 + 5 = 8 $$.
